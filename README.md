# SP15-HATCHET
The SP-15 Hatchet is an open source, half dart miniwheel (hurricane/pulsar) flywheel platform that feeds from straight talons or tachis, and is styled after the Alternator from Titanfall 2. It fires with a semi-auto, manual pusher (think gryphon), and is compatible with straight 15 round talons, curved 18 round talons, and curved 29 round tachis. The design is licensed GNU GPL 3.0, allowing for derivatives and sales as long as all derivatives are also licensed GNU GPL.
